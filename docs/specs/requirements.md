# Project Requirements Specification

## Project Overview
HIPAA-compliant encrypted medical notes management system with local AI processing for healthcare professionals

## Domain Context: HEALTHCARE
This project operates in the healthcare domain, which requires:
- **HIPAA Compliance**: All medical data must be encrypted and access-controlled
- **Privacy by Design**: Zero-trust architecture with end-to-end encryption
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all data access and modifications
- **Local Processing**: AI/ML operations must run locally to prevent data leakage
- **Data Sovereignty**: Users maintain full control over their medical records

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
- [ ] **Encrypted Medical Note Storage**: AES-256 encryption for all medical records
- [ ] **Local AI Processing**: Medical note analysis and insights without cloud dependency
- [ ] **Secure Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication with biometric support
- [ ] **HIPAA-Compliant Audit Logging**: Immutable audit trails for compliance
- [ ] **Export/Import Functionality**: Secure backup and restore capabilities
- [ ] **Search & Indexing**: Encrypted search across medical notes and records

### Security Requirements
- [ ] **End-to-End Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Assume breach, verify everything
- [ ] **Key Management**: Secure key derivation and rotation protocols
- [ ] **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with principle of least privilege
- [ ] **Data Loss Prevention**: Prevent unauthorized data exfiltration

### Privacy Requirements
- [ ] **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary medical information
- [ ] **Consent Management**: Clear user consent for all data processing
- [ ] **Right to Erasure**: Secure deletion of user data upon request
- [ ] **Anonymization**: De-identify data for analytics while preserving utility

### AI/ML Requirements
- [ ] **Local Model Deployment**: Run medical AI models entirely offline
- [ ] **Federated Learning Support**: Train models without centralizing data
- [ ] **Model Interpretability**: Explainable AI for medical decision support
- [ ] **Bias Detection**: Monitor and mitigate algorithmic bias in healthcare

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] **Response Time**: Sub-second response for note retrieval
- [ ] **Scalability**: Support 100,000+ encrypted medical records per user
- [ ] **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation

### Security
- [ ] **Encryption Standards**: AES-256, RSA-4096, ECDH P-384
- [ ] **Authentication**: Multi-factor with biometric and hardware tokens
- [ ] **Compliance**: HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2 Type II standards

### Usability
- [ ] **Medical Professional UX**: Intuitive interface for healthcare workflows
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design
- [ ] **Mobile Support**: Cross-platform mobile application

## Technical Constraints
- **Platform**: Cross-platform desktop and mobile applications
- **Deployment**: Local-first architecture with optional secure cloud sync
- **Integration**: HL7 FHIR compatibility for healthcare interoperability
- **Compliance**: Medical device software classification consideration

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All medical data must be encrypted with user-controlled keys
2. AI processing must occur entirely on local devices
3. System must pass HIPAA security risk assessment
4. Zero medical data transmitted to external servers without explicit consent
5. Complete audit trail for all data access and modifications

## Success Metrics
- **Security**: Zero data breaches, 100% encryption coverage
- **Privacy**: User control over 100% of their medical data
- **Performance**: <500ms average response time for medical note operations
- **Compliance**: Pass independent HIPAA compliance audit
